    I'm not sure I want to use SQLite *again*, maybe I should give nutsdb a
    try. It has transactions, runs embedded, and it's written in pure Go.
    On the other hand, SQLite just works, and it takes care of so many
    problems.
    *sigh* I'm going to use SQLite. There is no reason /not/ to use it,
    really.

    I'm going to use a web server both for the frontend and for the
    client-server communication. I'll need the web server anyway, might as
    well use it for the clients instead of hand-rolling some half-baked
    protocol myself.
*** Client [0/0]

    The client should be relatively straightforward, I think. I'm going to
    start here and work on gathering the data required.
